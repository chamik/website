## Who?

Hey there, interwebs wanderer! My name is **Jakub Hampl**. I also go by **Kub√≠k** or **chamik**.

I am a programmer -- enjoyer of written fiction, colorful lizards and cattos.

## What?

I am most interested in backend, algorithmization, games and small utility programs. I create stuff using mostly C#, Python and Julia. Sometimes even Rust, JS, TS, LabVIEW and C. I have experience with Linux because I use Arch btw. Here's [the stuff I use](/void/tools).

When I'm not programming, I like to read a book, play guitar, or touch grass outside. I have a beautiful chameleon named [Leo](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/719587027233800192/858445373034201169/IMG_20210614_144456.jpg){:target="_blank"}.

From September 2020 I had been an administrator over at the [Czech branch of SCP Foundation](http://scp-wiki.cz){:target="_blank"} and I'm still an active member. From September 2022 I am employed at [Algorithmics](https://cz.alg.academy/) where I teach Python and Scratch.

I dislike bureaucracy and anything that has to do with CSS.

## Why?

I don't know, actually. One thing is for sure though. If you see this picture somewhere online, you can be pretty sure it's me.

Also, please feel free to reach out about anything. Be it about the environmental impacts of [blockchain DNS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mayrhofer-did-dns/){:target="_blank"} or fun facts about racoons.
