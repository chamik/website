## Who?

Hey there, interwebs wanderer! My name is **Jakub Hampl**. I also go by **Kub√≠k** or **chamik**.

I am a programmer, administrator of the [Czech branch of the SCP Foundation](http://scp-wiki.cz){:target="_blank"}, a guitar player and an enjoyer of fiction and colorful lizards.

## What?

I am most interested in BE, games, and small command-line tools. I create stuff using mostly C#, Python, and Bash. I've also worked with Rust, JS, TS, LabVIEW, and C. I have some experience with Linux as I use Arch btw. Here's [the stuff I use](/void/tools).

[The SCP Foundation](http://scpwiki.com){:target="_blank"} is an amazing community and I'm maintaining the [Czech branch (CS)](http://scp-wiki.cz){:target="_blank"} since September 2020. Most of my free time gets channeled into this site.

When I'm not programming, I like to read a book, solve twisty puzzles, play guitar, or touch grass outside. I have a beautiful chameleon named [Leo](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/719587027233800192/858445373034201169/IMG_20210614_144456.jpg){:target="_blank"}.

I dislike bureaucracy and anything that has to do with CSS.

## Why?

I don't know, actually. One thing is for sure though. If you see this picture somewhere online, you can be pretty sure it's me.

Also, please feel free to reach out about anything. Be it about the environmental impacts of [blockchain DNS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mayrhofer-did-dns/){:target="_blank"} or fun facts about racoons.
