## Who?

Greetings, internet wanderer. They call me Kub√≠k, I'm also known as `chamik` on the internet.

I am a programmer. I sometimes play the guitar, climb a wall or touch grass outside. [I like to read](https://knih.chamik.eu/) (mostly sci-fi) and sometimes even write something. I teach programming to younger generations. I like tea and believe in the goodness of humanity. Regrettably, I'm still stuck in high school.

Most of my projects can be found on my [github](https://github.com/chamik), the rest somewhere here on the site.

Be it about anything, [reach out](/contact)!
