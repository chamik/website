## PGP

If you want to share something secret, you can encrypt it using my PGP key. It's ID is <span style="display: inline-block;">**`D4ED56EA AB50ED5D`**</span>.

You can download it from most major PGP servers (eg. [keyserver.ubuntu.com](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=kubik%40chamik.eu&fingerprint=on&op=index) or [pgp.mit.edu](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=kubik%40chamik.eu&op=vindex&fingerprint=on))

The fingerprint is: <span style="display: inline-block;">**`2694 FE30 8179 CBEA 69C2  BA79 D4ED 56EA AB50 ED5D`**</span>

I'll be happy to sign your key(s) if I know you.

### Fun fact

As per the [official documentation](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#AEN84){:target="_blank"} the fingerprint should be verified in person, or over the **phone**. So you are free to call me on Discord or whatever if you feel like it lmao.
