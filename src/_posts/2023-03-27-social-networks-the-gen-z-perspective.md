## Social networks - the Gen Z(ish) perspective

I have been born into the embracing hands of social networks. I remember creating my first Facebook account even though I didn't have my parents permission (sorry mum). It was great though! I could just *message* my friends instead of emailing them (yes, I am *old enough* to have done that).

These days I feel they create more of a social barrier. We live in the most interconnected times, yet we feel the most lonely. Where did it all go wrong?

### I'm sorry my hand just did that

On a whim, I decided to delete my social media apps for a month until my 18th birthday. Snapchat, Instagram, BeReal, Reddit, all gone. Not with some clear benefits in mind, just as a mental detox. 

I found myself reaching for my phone and clicking the *social media folder* only to realize it's not there and I'm opening a dictionary. I shuffled with the app layout.

Still, I was *just staring* into the screen with no clear intent. The dopamine shot that used to come after this disappeared, but my subconscious was still searching. It's scary how that's been engraved into my muscle memory. So I channeled this focus into other apps such as chess. On one hand I got better at chess, but it didn't help the fact that I am just constantly picking that darn thing up.

A month passes and I download Instagram again; the habit returns. *Quickly*. At this point I feel like a junkie in those drug prevention movies for adolescents -- *Failing to handle his addiction, he picks up the needle once again. Don't be like him kids!*

### Are social media literally crack??

If everyone else around you did crack then yes,
