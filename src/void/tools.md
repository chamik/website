## Tools

To do my day to day stuff, I use a bunch of tools I think are really cool and handy. Maybe you'll find them interesting as well.

---

### System

I use [the Linux of the curved structure](https://archlinux.org/){:target="_blank"}.
My WM is [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm){:target="_blank"}, and my shell is [fish](https://fishshell.com/){:target="_blank"}.
Terminal emulator of choice is [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty){:target="_blank"}.

### Text editors

If I had to choose one, it would be [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). For me it's the most versatile and easy to use editor available. The `$EDITOR` variable is assigned to [neovim](https://neovim.io/), the ultimate command line editor. And whenever I'm working on a bigger project I use [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)' editors (mostly [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider)).

### Utility

[Howdy](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy) is a "Windows Hello" style authentication program for Linux. It's cool as heck and saves the three seconds it takes to type your password every time.

I use [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) as my launcher for everything. (It's just nicer than dmenu I'm sorry)

### Other things I can't be bothered to write a description about
